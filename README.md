<h1>Simple Router Exploit</h1><br>
This is the barebones for a very basic router exploit using Paramiko.
If anyone would like to improve my code please do so.
You must enter the IP of the target router and then suspected username / password to the router in the file.

You must first have Paramiko installed<br>
you can do so by using this command if you have python installed:<br>

pip install paramiko
